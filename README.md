# MealCreator
This is a simple meal generator that takes a selection of ingredients and displays some recipes you could make with them. The intent of the program is to display some of the basic Tkinter GUI library features and how to implement them.
# Installation
Python is required for the program to be run. Tkinter is included with all Python Distributions so no further dependencies are needed.
To run the program, simply clone the repository and run the program from MealGenerator.py.
